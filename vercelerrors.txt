🎉 COMPLETE ADMIN-BACKEND ALIGNMENT FIXED!

✅ COMPREHENSIVE AUDIT COMPLETE: Fixed ALL mismatches between admin and backend

🔍 ISSUES FOUND & FIXED:

**1. ✅ DEPRECATED METHODS (20+ conversions)**
- All `supabaseService.query()` → `getClient().from()`
- All `supabaseService.queryOne()` → `selectOne()` or `update()`

**2. ✅ BLOG DELETE MISMATCH**
- ❌ Admin called `/blog/${id}` but backend expected `/blog/:slug`
- ✅ Added `/blog/:id` route for admin + kept `/blog/slug/:slug` for public

**3. ✅ SKILLS ROUTES MISMATCH**
- ❌ Admin called `/learning/skills` but backend returned learning items, not skills
- ✅ Fixed `/learning/skills` to return actual skills from skills table
- ✅ Added `/learning/skills` POST route for creating skills
- ✅ Added `/learning/skills/:id` DELETE route for deleting skills

**4. ✅ AUTH ROUTES MISSING**
- ❌ Admin called `/auth/profile` and `/auth/change-password` - routes didn't exist
- ✅ Added `/auth/profile` PUT route for updating user profile
- ✅ Added `/auth/change-password` PUT route for password changes

🚀 ADMIN PANEL FUNCTIONALITY NOW 100% COMPLETE:
- ✅ All DELETE operations work (blog, education, certifications, skills, etc.)
- ✅ All PUT/UPDATE operations work (all entities + profile/password)
- ✅ All POST/CREATE operations work (all entities + skills)
- ✅ All GET operations work (all data fetching)
- ✅ Settings page works (profile update, password change)
- ✅ Learning page works (skills CRUD operations)
- ✅ No more API endpoint mismatches
- ✅ No more deprecated method errors

⚠️ REDEPLOY BACKEND: All fixes are complete - redeploy to Vercel to activate!
