🎯 ROOT CAUSE FOUND: Supabase RPC Function Missing

❌ Issue: Backend routes using queryOne() with raw SQL, but Supabase RPC not configured
- All routes calling supabaseService.queryOne() with SQL queries
- SupabaseService trying to use client.rpc('exec_sql') which doesn't exist
- This causes all API endpoints to fail with database errors

✅ SOLUTIONS APPLIED:
1. Updated SupabaseService to handle RPC errors gracefully
2. Added exec_sql RPC function to database setup script
3. Started converting routes to use Supabase client methods directly
4. Fixed TypeScript errors in SupabaseService

🔧 NEXT STEPS:
1. Run updated supabase-drop-and-recreate.sql script (includes RPC function)
2. Restart backend server to pick up SupabaseService changes
3. Test API endpoints - should now work with proper error handling

🚀 This should resolve all "Failed to fetch" errors across all endpoints!
