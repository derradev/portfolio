✅ DUPLICATE ROUTES & MIDDLEWARE ISSUES FIXED!

🎯 ADDITIONAL PROBLEMS FOUND & FIXED:
- Education & Certifications had DUPLICATE DELETE routes
- Inconsistent middleware syntax causing auth failures
- Missing AuthRequest imports

🔧 BACKEND ROUTE FIXES:
- ✅ Education: Removed duplicate DELETE route, fixed middleware syntax
- ✅ Certifications: Removed duplicate DELETE route, fixed middleware syntax
- ✅ Both now use: `[authenticate, authorize('admin')]` (array syntax)
- ✅ Both now use: `AuthRequest` type for proper typing
- ✅ Added missing AuthRequest imports

📍 MIDDLEWARE STANDARDIZATION:
- OLD: `authenticate, authorize('admin')` (inconsistent)
- NEW: `[authenticate, authorize('admin')]` (matches working routes)
- Added proper TypeScript typing with AuthRequest

🚀 EXPECTED RESULTS:
- ✅ Education DELETE buttons will now work
- ✅ Certifications DELETE buttons will now work
- ✅ Consistent authentication across all routes
- ✅ No more duplicate route conflicts
- ✅ Proper TypeScript typing

⚠️ NEXT STEPS:
1. Redeploy backend to activate route fixes
2. Test DELETE operations in admin panel
3. All authentication should work consistently now
