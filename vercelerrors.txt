FIXED: All TypeScript errors resolved!

✅ Fixed Issues:
- Removed old auth.ts file (replaced with supabase-auth.ts)
- Removed migrate-new.ts file (replaced with supabase-full-setup.sql)
- Updated middleware/auth.ts to use SupabaseService
- Removed all old DatabaseService and VaultService files
- Cleaned up package.json dependencies
- Removed force-analytics.ts utility file

✅ Current Backend Architecture:
- All routes use SupabaseService
- Authentication via Supabase Auth
- Database operations via Supabase client
- No more localhost references
- Ready for Vercel deployment

Next deployment should succeed!
