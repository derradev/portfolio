✅ FIXED: All Delete Functions Using Deprecated Methods

❌ ROOT CAUSE: All delete routes were using deprecated query()/queryOne() methods
- Blog posts couldn't be deleted
- Projects, learning, work history deletes also broken
- All using raw SQL DELETE statements

✅ DELETE FUNCTIONS FIXED:

**1. Blog Posts Delete:**
- OLD: `queryOne('SELECT...') + query('DELETE FROM blog_posts...')`
- NEW: `getClient().from('blog_posts').delete().eq('slug', slug).select().single()`

**2. Projects Delete:**
- OLD: `queryOne('SELECT...') + query('DELETE FROM projects...')`
- NEW: `getClient().from('projects').delete().eq('id', id).select().single()`

**3. Learning Delete:**
- OLD: `queryOne('SELECT...') + query('DELETE FROM learning...')`
- NEW: `getClient().from('learning').delete().eq('id', id).select().single()`

**4. Work History Delete:**
- OLD: `queryOne('SELECT...') + query('DELETE FROM work_history...')`
- NEW: `getClient().from('work_history').delete().eq('id', id).select().single()`

🚀 RESULT: All delete functions now use proper Supabase client methods
- Blog post deletion should now work properly
- Better error handling with single operation
- No more deprecated method errors for deletes
