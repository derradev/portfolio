FIXED: Admin Deployment MIME Type Issues

❌ Problem: Admin serving index.html for all requests including CSS/JS assets
- CSS files returning text/html instead of text/css
- JS files returning text/html instead of application/javascript

✅ Solution: Fixed admin vercel.json routing configuration
- Added specific routes for /assets/* files
- Added routes for static file extensions (.css, .js, .png, etc.)
- Catch-all route to index.html only for non-asset requests

🚀 Admin deployment should now serve assets with correct MIME types!
