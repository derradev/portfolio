SOLUTION: Deploy as Separate Vercel Projects

🎯 Root Cause: 
- Trying to deploy 3 services (frontend, backend, admin) in one Vercel project
- Complex routing causing deployment conflicts
- CORS issues due to improper service isolation

✅ Solution Created:
- Separate vercel.json for each service
- Individual deployment configurations
- Clean service isolation

📁 New Structure:
1. Frontend: Root `/vercel.json` → demitaylornimmo.com
2. Backend: `/packages/backend/vercel.json` → api.demitaylornimmo.com  
3. Admin: `/packages/admin/vercel.json` → admin.demitaylornimmo.com

📖 See DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md for step-by-step instructions
