FIXED: CORS Error for Admin Panel

✅ Solution:
- Updated CORS configuration in both index.ts and vercel.ts
- Added https://api.demitaylornimmo.com to allowed origins
- Enhanced CORS with explicit methods and headers
- Added optionsSuccessStatus: 200 for preflight requests

✅ CORS now allows:
- https://admin.demitaylornimmo.com
- https://demitaylornimmo.com
- https://api.demitaylornimmo.com
- All Vercel preview URLs

Admin panel should now be able to access the API!
