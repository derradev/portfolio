FIXED: Script Path Issue

❌ Problem: Vercel couldn't find ignore-build-step.sh script
Error: "bash: ../scripts/ignore-build-step.sh: No such file or directory"

✅ Solution Applied:
- Copied ignore-build-step.sh into each package directory:
  - packages/frontend/ignore-build-step.sh
  - packages/backend/ignore-build-step.sh  
  - packages/admin/ignore-build-step.sh
- Updated all vercel.json files to use local script: "bash ignore-build-step.sh [service]"

🎯 Benefits:
- No more path issues
- Each service has its own copy
- Vercel can always find the script locally
- More reliable deployments
