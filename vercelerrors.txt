🔧 FIXING: Local Development Issues

❌ Issues Found:
1. Admin Panel: Rollup/Vite module error (@rollup/rollup-darwin-arm64)
2. Backend: Supabase environment variables not loading

✅ Fixes Applied:
- Cleared all node_modules and package-lock.json files
- Reinstalled all dependencies with npm install
- Enhanced backend environment variable loading (multiple .env paths)
- Added environment variable debugging to backend startup

🔄 Next: Try npm run dev again - both issues should be resolved
