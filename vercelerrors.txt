✅ FIXED: Express Configuration Issues

❌ Previous Errors:
1. ValidationError: X-Forwarded-For header with trust proxy false
2. Error: Not Found - /api/experiance (misspelled endpoint)

✅ FIXES APPLIED:

**1. Trust Proxy Configuration:**
- Added `app.set('trust proxy', 1)` for Vercel deployment
- Fixes rate limiter X-Forwarded-For header validation
- Properly handles proxy headers in production

**2. Missing Experience/Education Endpoints:**
- Added `/api/experience` as alias for education routes
- Added `/api/experiance` to handle common misspelling
- Both now route to existing education controller

🚀 RESULT:
- Rate limiter now works properly in Vercel environment
- No more 404 errors for experience/education endpoints
- Backend handles both correct and misspelled endpoint names
