### About Me Section

**About Me Description:**
- I'm Will, an IT Technician with hands-on experience across the full spectrum of technical support—from Active Directory and user/group management to hardware setup, maintenance, and software deployment via PDQ. I handle helpdesk tickets with a practical, solution-focused approach, understanding that end users need clear communication as much as they need technical fixes. My role requires me to balance immediate firefighting with longer-term system administration, and I've developed the ability to context-switch quickly between troubleshooting a failing workstation and managing group policies across the network.

What sets me apart is my commitment to actually understanding how things work rather than just following procedures. I don't settle for surface-level fixes—I want to know why something broke and how to prevent it next time. This curiosity extends to my development work in Python, where I prioritize learning concepts that stick over quick copy-paste solutions. My current role isn't just about maintaining systems—it's building the foundation for my ultimate goal of transitioning into cybersecurity. I understand that effective security professionals need to know systems inside and out: how users interact with them, where vulnerabilities emerge in daily operations, and how seemingly small misconfigurations can create exploitable weaknesses. Every ticket I resolve, every user account I manage, and every deployment I handle is teaching me about attack surfaces, access control, and the human factors that make security both critical and challenging.

I bring a direct, no-nonsense approach to problem-solving while maintaining the patience needed for effective user support. I understand that technical work isn't just about systems—it's about the people using them, and in cybersecurity, that human element is often the most critical vulnerability to address. This combination of technical depth, genuine curiosity, security-minded thinking, and grounded communication makes me someone who doesn't just fix problems but actively thinks about preventing them—exactly the mindset that separates good cybersecurity professionals from great ones.

1. IT Infrastructure & System Administration
   - Active Directory, user/group management, Group Policy

   - Access control and privilege management
   - Identifying and mitigating security misconfigurations
   - User security awareness and training

3. Python Development & Automation
   - Learning Python for security automation
   - Scripting for IT tasks and workflow optimization
   - Focus on understanding concepts, not just syntax

4. Cybersecurity Foundations (In Progress)
   - Building knowledge through hands-on learning
